\li To generate a moving average, we take a time window, say the first 20 days in the time series.
\li Calculate the average price over these 20 days.
\li Then move the time window by one day, so it now spans the 2nd to 21st day.
\li Calculate the average over these 20 days.
\li Move the time window again, and so on.
\li The result is a new time series consisting of a sequence of averaged prices.
